# HTML Custom Select with mCustomScrollbar
A very simple way to make a custom dropdown select. Using http://manos.malihu.gr jQuery Plugin to custom scrollbar.

If you are a Front-end developer like me, this is a common situation for you.

You open the PSD, start to cut the images you want, and surprise... the designer customize all the "selects", and the scrollbars :D (Thanks designers).
Tired to use another plugins, I just want to make this thing a little fast and simple.

Using jQuery to make this, the click in a option get the attribute 'data-value' of the item and set to a hidden input to work normal inside a form tag :D.
Works with multiple custom selects.
